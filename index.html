               <p>
                  "The team Bowl or Nothing was founded in the winter of 2021 by Jordan. Originally it was just an idea to get friends together on a Monday night and socialize and have fun. None of us had ever been in a bowling league before but we quickly grew to love the sport and even practiced in between league nights. We werent very good to start and quickly sank to the bottom of the standinds. But we perservered and continued improving eventually finishing the season in fifth place which was good enough to make the playoffs. On the night of the playoffs we were nervous but we all bowled extremely well and took home the championship as underdogs!!"
